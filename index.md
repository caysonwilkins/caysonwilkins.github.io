Computer Vision is a very useful research topic that is really starting to be seen used much much more in the present day and looks as though it will continue to be used more in the future. So, you might ask the question of what computer vision is? well to start, computer vision, sometimes abbreviated as CV, is a field of study that looks to create techniques to help computers "see" as you might call it and understand what is in digital content such as photos and videos. The problem of getting a computer to recognize certain aspects of an image seems simple since it is something that every person and children develop on their own through their sight but seems impossible to teach a computer to always identify these things correctly. Since things can vary so much in how they appear such as people all looking different makes this a difficult challenge. For example, if you want to train a computer to recognize an apple in a photograph, you will have to recognize that apples can often be different shapes whether it is whole or sliced, colors, and even different stages of being ripe, freshly grown, or in the rotting process, it is still an apple. You can see examples of some computer vision software being used in many different devices today and maybe even in your pocket. This could be your smart phone with their facial recognition software to recognizing a shape of a person in a photo to recognize that there is in fact a person in a photo. The history of computer vision to progress and try and fix many of the struggles that are faced with the idea of computer vision help us to reach todays climate with fixing present day issues. This includes helping with the largest issue we have today of Covid-19.

Computer vision is a study that started quite a while ago and has been developed in techniques very largely in present day. It is often accepted that the father of Computer Vision is Larry Roberts Ph. D in 1960 at MIT with the idea of extracting 3D information from 2D perspective views of blocks (Haung). Those following Artificial Intelligence also took an interest in researching computer vision in the context of the blocks world as they are related. Computer Vision is a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in order to create this technology and strategies.

Sometimes Computer Vision is looked at as equivalent to image processing, but it is very distinct from it. Image processing is the process of creating new images from existing images usually through simplifying or enhancing the existing image content and isn't concerned with understanding the image and it's content. Computer Vision systems may use image processing to create a better image pre-processing the image through computer vision software, but the actual research and act of computer vision is focused on understanding an image.

There are many challenges that are faced when researching computer vision, because as it turns out, helping a computer to see turns out to be very difficult. This quote from an article written in 2012 explains how it can be a struggle to give a computer "vision". "The goal of computer vision is to extract useful information from images. This has proved a surprisingly challenging task; it has occupied thousands of intelligent and creative minds over the last four decades, and despite this we are still far from being able to build a general-purpose â€œseeing machine." (Brownlee). One reason teaching a computer to "see" on the same level as humans could be considered difficult because we as humanity don't quite have a strong grasp of how human vision works. This would require us to commit more research and understanding to the organs involved in perception like the eyes and the interpretation of the perception inside the brain. Another reason the task is difficult is because of the complexity of the visual world and the perception of the specific item. An object can be seen from any direction or orientation, any lighting conditions, any occlusion from other items, and more. A fully working system of vision needs to be able to identify and capture what is happening in an image in an infinite number of scenarios and scenes and still get the same meaning or outcome from the image.

There are many different tasks trying to be accomplished in today's world with the use of computer vision, some of them include things like Optical character recognition (OCR), machine inspection, medical imaging, automotive safety, surveillance, and retail such as automated checkouts. One major thing that has happened recently as everyone will have noticed right now is the pandemic and spread of COVID-19. There is currently research going on trying to join the fight in controlling the virus. Many of the key areas of research include topics of Diagnosis, Prevention and control, and clinical management and treatment as shown in the figure below.

The attempt to create more reliable, faster, and affordable methods of diagnosis through computer vision is one of the main goals, using computer vision to quickly identify key features of a CT scan to diagnose is one way and X-Rays another way through the visual nature of these tests. One of the largest and more worldwide desires for computer vision to aid in in this particular moment is prevention and control of the virus since there are already some methods of somewhat quick diagnosis solutions. The use of computer vision can aid in this pandemic through some solutions such as masks facial recognition to increase the use of masks for preventative matters. Zhongyuan Wang proposed this solution and found a resulting 95% accuracy on a masked face images dataset (Ulhaq, 13). This could be a useful and most of the time reliable solution for businesses or governments to enforce mask mandates if they desire. Another early on suggested solution using computer vision in containing and slowing the spread of the virus was through infrared thermal screening and using computer vision to identify if individuals had a fever. This could potentially help with both the issue of identifying who is infected and prevent the individual from spreading the virus to their peers and community. We can use computer vision to help with treatment in identifying those patients that are in more critical condition to get them the immediate attention they need. There is a score type system that exists called "corona score" which is calculated through measurements of infected areas and severity through CT images. As explained in the identifying situation before, we know it is possible to use computer vision in identifying certain conditions of a CT scan if we can train the computer properly through effective algorithms and machine learning techniques.

As we can see, computer vision is a very large topic that has lots of potential to help with many things in our society. It has a history that started many years ago that started with a simple idea and developed into much more complex ideologies. With the combination of machine learning and artificial intelligence improvements developed over the years, we can see computer vision start to progress alongside it. These progressions have been seen developed in recent years with the ideas of self-driving cars and the ability to recognize road lines, facial recognition for phones, and even in very recent issues, try and solve global pandemic problems. With computer vision progressing, we will be sure to see it be more useful and more widely used as it develops in the future.
