Computer Vision is a very useful research topic that is really starting to be seen used much much more in the present day and looks as though it will continue to be used more in the future. So, you might ask the question of what computer vision is? well to start, computer vision, sometimes abbreviated as CV, is a field of study that looks to create techniques to help computers "see" as you might call it and understand what is in digital content such as photos and videos. The problem of getting a computer to recognize certain aspects of an image seems simple since it is something that every person and children develop on their own through their sight but seems impossible to teach a computer to always identify these things correctly. Since things can vary so much in how they appear such as people all looking different makes this a difficult challenge. For example, if you want to train a computer to recognize an apple in a photograph, you will have to recognize that apples can often be different shapes whether it is whole or sliced, colors, and even different stages of being ripe, freshly grown, or in the rotting process, it is still an apple. You can see examples of some computer vision software being used in many different devices today and maybe even in your pocket. This could be your smart phone with their facial recognition software to recognizing a shape of a person in a photo to recognize that there is in fact a person in a photo.

Computer vision is a study that started quite a while ago and has been developed in techniques very largely in present day. It is often accepted that the father of Computer Vision is Larry Roberts Ph. D in 1960 at MIT with the idea of extracting 3D information from 2D perspective views of blocks (Haung). Those following Artificial Intelligence also took an interest in researching computer vision in the context of the blocks world as they are related. Computer Vision is a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in order to create this technology and strategies.

Sometimes Computer Vision is looked at as equivalent to image processing, but it is very distinct from it. Image processing is the process of creating new images from existing images usually through simplifying or enhancing the existing image content and isn't concerned with understanding the image and it's content. Computer Vision systems may use image processing to create a better image pre-processing the image through computer vision software, but the actual research and act of computer vision is focused on understanding an image.

There are many challenges that are faced when researching computer vision, because as it turns out, helping computer to see turns out to be very difficult. This quote from an article written in 2012 explains how it can be a struggle to give a computer "vision". "The goal of computer vision is to extract useful information from images. This has proved a surprisingly challenging task; it has occupied thousands of intelligent and creative minds over the last four decades, and despite this we are still far from being able to build a general-purpose â€œseeing machine." (Brownlee).
